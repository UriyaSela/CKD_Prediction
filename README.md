## Introduction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict CKD based on electronic medical records.

## Data Preparation and EDA

- Perform exploratory data analysis.
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables and standardize numerical variables.
- Provide a concise dataset description and insights.

## Feature Selection

- Apply two feature selection techniques.
- Explain and justify the chosen techniques.
- Present the selected features with visualizations.

## Class Imbalance Handling

- Analyze the target variable distribution.
- Apply two techniques to address class imbalance.
- Demonstrate the new class distribution.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Train at least four classification models.
- Evaluate models using metrics like AUC-ROC, F1-Score, recall, precision, etc.
- Detail hyperparameter optimization methods.
- Compare model performance using ROC and Recall-Precision plots.
- Select the best model based on performance metrics.

## AI Interpretation

- Apply two AI interpretation techniques.
- Implement SHAP.
- Interpret and visually present the explanations.
- Discuss the findings and their clinical relevance.

## Subgroup Analysis

- Identify homogeneous subgroups using clusters.
- Build a CKD prediction model for each subgroup.
- Compare subgroup model performance to the overall model.

## Reporting

- Abstract
- Introduction and Objectives
- Methodology
- Findings
- Conclusions: Summarize findings, discuss machine learning effectiveness in CKD prediction, and suggest further research directions.
